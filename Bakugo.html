          <p> Bakugo and Midoriya were both friends since childhood. Midoriya
            admires Bakugo's quirk as he never was born with a quirk himself.
            There relationship is a love/hate friendship. Bakugo wants to pursue
            his dream which is to become the number one hero which is Midoriya's
            dream as well.
